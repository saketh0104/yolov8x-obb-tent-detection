# 🛰️ Unauthorized Encampment Detection in Satellite Imagery

This project focuses on detecting **unauthorized encampments** in satellite imagery using state-of-the-art **deep learning techniques**. Encampments, often temporary settlements or illegal constructions, pose challenges for urban planning, environmental monitoring, and law enforcement. By leveraging **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** object detection, the system provides automated, scalable, and accurate detection.

---

## 📌 Features
- **Automated Detection**: Identifies encampments in high-resolution satellite images.
- **Deep Learning Powered**: Uses YOLO for real-time object detection.
- **Custom Dataset**: Trained on annotated satellite imagery with encampment labels.
- **Scalable**: Can be extended to detect other land-use features.
- **Visualization**: Bounding boxes highlight detected encampments in output images.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Model**: YOLOv8x-OBB 
- **Data Handling**: OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab / Local GPU
